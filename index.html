        <p>In this project I try to extend the data                              clustering algorithm presented in a paper by                              Casagrande et al. titled "Hamiltonian-Based                              Clustering: Algorithms for Static and Dynamic                              Clustering in Data Mining and Image Processing" to                              a more general setting. Hamiltonian dynamics live                              on a even dimensional space and my aim is to                              instaed work on a more general space that allows                              the Hamiltonian dynamics to live on an odd                              dimensional space. The main assumption is that the                              data lives on the phase space and at each data                              point a Gaussian function is assigned to it.                              Hamiltonian systems tend to evolve along                              trajectories on the phase space where the                              Hamiltonian remains constant and when the motion                              is period that corresponds to closed loops in the                              phase space. The idea to use Hamiltonian systems                              to find the boundaries of the sets. </p>                            <p>As it is with Hamiltonian dynamics, it requires                              the points to be defined on a cotangent bundle,                              and cotangent bundles are symplectic manifolds.                              The limitations of that is that symplectic                              manifolds are even dimensional manifolds and thus                              for the data clustering algorithm to work, it                              requires the data to be even dimensional. The main                              example used in aforementioned paper is data in                              the form of images, which is a two-dimensional                              plane. The complications arise when the data is                              gathered from the real world, say data that lives                              on the surface of a sphere. In this case the data                              lives in a three-dimensional space and it cannot                              be a symplectic manifold. One possible solution,                              suggested in the paper [1], is to embed                              odd-dimensional data into an even-dimensional                              space. Here, we try to circumvent such solution by                              not adding an extra dimension. </p>                            <p>We consider an example in three dimensions where                              the \(N\) data points, \(\mathbf{x_k} \in                              \mathbb{R}^3\) for\(k=1, \dots, N \), for a spiral                              on the surface of a sphere. The aim is to find a                              set, \(\mathcal{C}\), whose elements                              \(\mathbf{x_i}\) satisfy certain condition, and in                              this case the condition is that the elements of                              the sets needs to be adjacent to each other.</p>                            <p>This figure shows the result of Poisson data                              clustering algorithm. The data point are                              represented by solid blue dots and the boundary of                              the set is represented by the red curve.</p>                            <p></p>                            <h5>References:</h5>                            <p>[1] - D.

However, that was before the introduction of deep Q-networks and things have changed drastically afterwards. Here are few projects that I worked on to help me learn about reinforcement learning: </p> <h5>Stabilising an inverted double:</h5>                            <p>One of the entry problems in reinforcement learning is stabilising an inverted pendulum on a moving cart. The controls are either move the cart left or right depending on where the pendulum is starting to swing. Here a similar problem is considered and instead of a single pendulum a double pendulum is places on a moving cart. This renders the problem more challenging as the double pendulum is a chaotic system, but despite that it possesses two equilibrium point. Here, a deep Q-network is used to stabilise the inverted pendulum by moving the cart either left or right. </p>  <h5>Playing a side scrolling shoot 'em up:</h5>                            <p>Deep Q-network came to prominence when it was used to learn and play Atari games. Here instead of using the standard Atari games, a slightly different game is considered, which is coded from scratch. The game is based on Thunder Force IV. In order to use reinforcement learning to teach a computer to learn video games, either a convolutional neural network to read the screen and infer the state, or access an emulator's memory directly. The third option is to code a game from scratch and use it as a control system and feed the states directly to DQN. For this reason the game was coded using Gym AI.</p>                            <p></p>                          </div>                          <div class="col-md-6"> <center><img src="images/outputName3.gif"                              alt=""></center>                          </div>                          <div class="col-md-6"> <center><img src="images/doublePend7.gif"                              alt=""></center>                          </div>                          <div class="col-md-6"> <center><img src="images/doublePend_random.gif"                              alt=""></center>                          </div>                        </div>                      </div>                      <div class="modal-footer"> <button type="button" class="btn btn-sm btn-default"                          data-dismiss="modal">Close</button>                      </div>                    </div>                  </div>                </div>                <!-- Modal end --> </div>              <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-3 isotope-item machine-learning">                <div class="image-box">                  <div class="overlay-container"> <img src="images/portfolio-esn.jpg"                      alt="">                    <a class="overlay" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#project-3">                      <i class="fa fa-search-plus"></i> <span>Machine Learning</span>                    </a> </div>                  <a class="btn btn-default btn-block" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#project-3">Forecasting</a>                </div>                <!-- Modal -->                <div class="modal fade" id="project-3" tabindex="-1" role="dialog"                  aria-labelledby="project-3-label"                  aria-hidden="true">                  <div class="modal-dialog modal-lg">                    <div class="modal-content">                      <div class="modal-header"> <button type="button" class="close"                          data-dismiss="modal"><span                            aria-hidden="true">×</span><span                            class="sr-only">Close</span></button>                        <h4 class="modal-title" id="project-3-label">Forecasting</h4>                      </div>                      <div class="modal-body">                        <h3>Project Description</h3>                        <div class="row">                          <div class="col-md-6">                            <p>During my undergraduate studies I took courses on                              signals and systems and Bayesian inference. I                              became interested in studying systems and using                              mathematical models to not only control them, but                              also predicting their behavour. There are a number                              of ways, depending on the type of system and                              available data, one can forecast the states of the                              system in the future. I mainly worked on three                              methods and they are: reservoir computers,                              ensemble Kalman filter and symbolic regression. </p>                            <p> One of the type of neural network that intrigued                              me the most is reservoir computers, which are a                              variant of recurrent neural networks. What makes                              them interesting is that their efficiency in                              training, where they don't suffer most of the                              pathologies and complexities of reccurent nerual                              networks. Using them to forecast chaotic systems                              was presented in many paper such as Pathak et al's                              "Using machine learning to replicate chaotic                              attractors and calculate Lyapunov exponents from                              data". This caught my attention as I wanted to use                              such networks to implement data-driven control                              scheme of a black-box system. In the process of                              learning and implementing reservoir computers, I                              published a blog post on Medium.com, which can be                              accessed here. </p>                            <p>The second method used for forecasting is the                              Ensemble Kalman filter. Unlike the previous                              method, filtering does not substitute the model it                              enhances the current model. Such algorithm is used                              in many applications, from implementing feedback                              controllers to data assimilation and forecasting.                              This project is my implementation of Ensemble                              Kalman filter. The filter is an algorithm that,                              given a set of measures, generates the optimal                              estimate of the desired quantities through a                              recursive processing. The Ensemble Kalman filter                              and it uses Monte Carlo methods to approximate the                              statistics of the system. The algorithm relies on                              having the knowledge of the system and its                              measurement dynamics. In addition to that, the                              statistical description of the noise associated                              with the system, the measurement error and the                              uncertainty of the used dynamic models. </p>                            <p>To showcase my implementation of ensemble Kalman                              filter to estimate the state of the van der Pol                              oscillator, an nonlinear dynamical system,                              described by </p>                            $$ \begin{bmatrix} x_0^{k+1} \\ x_1^{k+1}                            \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} x_0^{k} + \Delta t                            \, x_1^{k} + w_0\\ x_1^{k} + \Delta t \, \left( \mu                            \left(1 - (x_0^{k})^2 \right)x_1^{k} - x_0^{k}                            \right) + w_1 \end{bmatrix} $$ where \(\Delta t\) is                            the time step, and here it was chosen to be                            \(0.01\), \(\mu = 1\), and \(\bar{w} \sim                            \mathcal{N}(0, Q)\) is a normally distributed random                            number with covariance \(Q = \mathrm{diag}(0.0262,                            0.008)\). ![](vanDerPolF.png)                            <p>Another example used to test the implementation                              of the ensemble Kalman filter is the Lorenz 63                              model, whose solution produces the famous Lorenz                              attractor.

The aim is instead of finding a                              network's weights, or changing the model's                              parameters, symbolic regression aim at finding a                              mathematical expression that closely fits the                              observed data. Evolutionary programming is often                              used to find the mathematical expression.

This enables us to                              find the limit of deep learning system when both                              the number of neurons and the number of layers                              approaches infinity. Recently, there has been an                              interest in formulating deep learning problems in                              terms of dynamical systems as was discussed in "A                              Proposal on Machine Learning via Dynamical                              Systems" by E. In fact, dynamical systems were                              used in many neural network architectures, such as                              recurrent neural network, echo state machines, and                              spiking neurons to name a few. For the case of                              spiking neurons, the continuum limit yields a                              hyperbolic partial differential equation and the                              field of study is known as neural field theory. In                              the mentioned architectures, dynamical systems are                              used to compute the neural network’s activation,                              while the recent focus is on using dynamical                              systems as a substitute for the whole                              architecture. Furthermore, the connection between                              training neural networks and optimal control has                              been an ongoing research.It is natural to think of                              optimal control as a method for training neural                              networks. Both problems aim to find parameters                              that would make a system give certain output when                              presented with specific inputs. There has been an                              interest in using a more general optimal control,                              mainly stochastic optimal control via mean field                              games. What is very interesting about this                              approach is it provides a pathway in formulating                              the stochastic control problems in fluid dynamics.                              The case for deterministic optimal control was                              shown that the control vector field does, indeed,                              satisfy the incompressible Euler fluid equation as                              it was shown in "An Optimal Control Formulation                              For Inviscid Incompressible Ideal Fluid Flow" by                              Bloch et al.</p>                            <h5>References:</h5>                            <p>[1] - W.

At that time                              I wanted to implement artificial intelligence                              controller for the navigation, however, due to                              hardware constraints such a controller wasn't                              used. Things has changed, hardware-wise, since                              last time I worked on such problem and now with                              the advances in artificial intelligence it is the                              right time to work on the same problem again. This                              project focuses on using data driven approach to                              programming robots to navigate environments and                              follow a prescribed trajectory. </p>                            <p>The trajectory tracking problem is a well known                              problem in control theory in which the aim is to                              find an input to the dynamical system that would                              result in a path close the predefined one. There                              are three ways in which one can implement a                              trajectory tracking method: using classical                              control theory tools, using a deep neural network                              controller, or reinforcement learning. Here we                              will only focus on the first approach, however,                              the mathematical model is not known to us                              beforehand and for that system identification                              using regression is used to construct a                              mathematical model heuristically. </p>                            <p>The first step in modelling the robot is by                              collecting the system's response to known input                              signals, i.e. give the robot a set of predefined                              commands and observe the behaviour. After data is                              collected, the data is used to solve a regression                              problem which yields an expression for the                              dynamical equation. Then an optimal control                              problem is solved to obtain a controller. As a                              testing problem for this automated framework, a                              trajectory tracking problem for a Dubins car type                              vehicle, that moves forward the control is the                              steering angle. The result can be seen in the                              figure on the right. </p>                            <p>Another way of tackling navigation problem is                              implementing an evolutionary robotic paradigm.                              Here the vehicle is Reed-Shepp type car where the                              speed and steering are the controls. The vehicle                              is equipped with five forward facing proximity                              sensors whose readings are fed, along with the                              vehicle's position, as inputs to the control                              neural network. The control here is implemented                              using feed-forward multilayer perceptron. Other                              network architectures can be used and the it is on                              the todo list to use reservoir computers for                              control. Most evolutionary process are implemented                              using genetic algorithms, here particle swarm                              optimisation is used to evolve the weights of the                              control neural network. </p>                            <p> Here, the particle swarm optimisation algorithm                              was interpreted as a Hamiltonian system. The                              advantage of using Hamiltonian dynamics with PSO                              is that it allows us to construct geometric                              integrators for the problem, which will circumvent                              a number of problems encountered by a naïve                              implantation the algorithm. </p>                            <p>Instead of describing it as a system of equation                              for the swarm in terms of position, \(x_i\) and                              velocity \(v_i\) as it is usually done, we                              describe it in terms of position \(q_i\) and                              conjugate momentum \(p_i\). The Hamiltonian here                              is a function \(H: \mathrm{T^{\ast}Q} \to                              \mathbb{R}\) given by </p>                            $$ \begin{aligned} H(p, q) &amp;= T + V_s + V_m \\                            &amp;= \frac{1}{2} \| p_i \|^2 + V_s(q_i) + V_m                            (q_i), \end{aligned} $$ where \(V_s : \mathrm{Q} \to                            \mathbb{R}\) is the social potential and \(V_m:                            \mathrm{Q} \to \mathbb{R}\) is the memory potential.                            By potential, we don't mean ''possibility of                            achieving", but rather as a potential energy. With                            that, the Hamilton's equation of motion is $$                            \begin{cases} \dot{q_i} = \frac{\partial H}{\partial                            p_i},\\ \dot{p_i} = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial q_i}                            \end{cases} $$ <a href="https://github.com/NaderTG/Hamiltonian_Particle_Swarm_Optimisation">My                              C++ implementation can be found here</a> </div>                          <div class="col-md-6"> <img src="images/portfolio-tracking.jpg"                              alt="">                          </div>                        </div>                      </div>                      <div class="modal-footer"> <button type="button" class="btn btn-sm btn-default"                          data-dismiss="modal">Close</button>                      </div>                    </div>                  </div>                </div>                <!-- Modal end --> </div>              <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-3 isotope-item control-theory">                <div class="image-box">                  <div class="overlay-container"> <img src="images/portfolio-optcontrol.jpg"                      alt="">                    <a class="overlay" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#project-6">                      <i class="fa fa-search-plus"></i> <span>Control Theory</span>                    </a> </div>                  <a class="btn btn-default btn-block" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#project-6">Pseudospectral                    Optimal Control</a> </div>                <!-- Modal -->                <div class="modal fade" id="project-6" tabindex="-1" role="dialog"                  aria-labelledby="project-6-label"                  aria-hidden="true">                  <div class="modal-dialog modal-lg">                    <div class="modal-content">                      <div class="modal-header"> <button type="button" class="close"                          data-dismiss="modal"><span                            aria-hidden="true">×</span><span                            class="sr-only">Close</span></button>                        <h4 class="modal-title" id="project-6-label">Pseudospectral                          Optimal Control</h4>                      </div>                      <div class="modal-body">                        <h3>Project Description</h3>                        <div class="row">                          <div class="col-md-6">                            <p>This project is an ongoing work to implement                              pseudospectral control methods, presented in a                              paper by Fahroo and Ross titled "Legendre                              Pseudospectral Approximations of Optimal Control                              Problems", using Python. The idea of the said                              method is to use pseudospectral approximations of                              functions to solve optimal control problems. An                              optimal control problem has three main components:                              cost function, state-constraint and dynamical                              constraint.

I                              came across RBMs after reading David MacKay's book                              "Information Theory, Inference, and Learning                              Algorithms" [1]. A Restricted Boltzmann Machine is a                              class of Markov random field, which is an                              undirected graphs used to visualise probability                              distributions. I worked on this project mainly to                              learn about Restricted Boltzmann Machines and Deep                              Belief Networks by understanding how they work by                              implementing them. RBMs is used in a number of                              real world applications such as classification and                              collaborative filtering. The main source used to                              learn about RBMs is a paper by Fischer and Igel                              titled "An Introduction to Restricted Boltzmann                              Machines" [2]. Also, the code is intended to be used                              for future research project related to the field                              of information geometry. </p>                            <p>An RBM consists of \(N_v \) visible units \(                              \vec{v} \), which represents observed data and \(                              N_h \) hidden units \(\vec{h} \). The units are                              interconnected, however, units from the same type                              are not connected with each other. The most common                              used type of RBMs, the hidden and visible units                              are binary random variables, that obey a Binomial                              distribution. The probability distributions over                              the model is given by </p>                            <p> \( P(\vec{v}, \vec{h}) =                              \frac{1}{Z}e^{-E(\vec{v}, \vec{h})}, \) </p>                            where \(Z \) is the normalising factor and \(                            E(\vec{v}, \vec{h})\) is the energy given by                            <p> \( E(\vec{v}, \vec{h}) =                              -\sum_{i=1}^{N_h}\sum_{j=1}^{N_v} w_{ij}v_jh_i -                              \sum_{i=1}^{N_h}c_ih_i - \sum_{j=1}^{N_v}b_j v_j,                              \) </p>                            where \(w_ij \) is the weight assigned to the                            connection between the \(j^{th} \) visible unit and                            the \(i^{th} \) hidden one and \(b_j\) and \(c_i \)                            are biases.

The hardware had                              non-commercial and non-standard architecture, so a                              completely new compiler was needed. Furthermore,                              the hardware lacked an arithmatic logic unit, thus                              a virtual machine was implemented to compensate                              for the missing unit. The addition of the virtual                              machine allows the use of many mathematical                              function to be used in the programming language.                              The compiler and the virtual machine are                              implemented in C and the Flex + Bison are used for                              the code parser. The project is a closed source,                              so no code is posted on Github. However, I wrote a                              parser code that generates C/MPI code from                              mathematical expression for stochastic                              differential equations. </p>                          </div>                          <div class="col-md-6"> <img src="images/portfolio-code.jpg"                              alt="">                          </div>                        </div>                      </div>                      <div class="modal-footer"> <button type="button" class="btn btn-sm btn-default"                          data-dismiss="modal">Close</button>                      </div>                    </div>                  </div>                </div>                <!-- Modal end --> </div>              <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-3 isotope-item misc">                <div class="image-box">                  <div class="overlay-container"> <img src="images/portfolio-sparse.jpg"                      alt="">                    <a class="overlay" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#project-10">                      <i class="fa fa-search-plus"></i> <span>Miscellaneous</span>                    </a> </div>                  <a class="btn btn-default btn-block" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#project-10">Sparse                    Grids</a> </div>                <!-- Modal -->                <div class="modal fade" id="project-10" tabindex="-1" role="dialog"                  aria-labelledby="project-10-label"                  aria-hidden="true">                  <div class="modal-dialog modal-lg">                    <div class="modal-content">                      <div class="modal-header"> <button type="button" class="close"                          data-dismiss="modal"><span                            aria-hidden="true">×</span><span                            class="sr-only">Close</span></button>                        <h4 class="modal-title" id="project-10-label">Sparse                          Grids</h4>                      </div>                      <div class="modal-body">                        <h3>Project Description</h3>                        <div class="row">                          <div class="col-md-6">                            <p> As I am interested in numerical schemes, and as                              a part of exploring adaptive schemes for                              multisymplectic integrators, I looked at sparse                              grids. One of their primary use is in quadrature                              of high dimensional integrals. Applying the                              quadrature methods and techniques designed for                              low-dimensional integrals, one would run into the                              dreaded <em>curse of dimensionality</em>, where                              it is required the use of \(\mathcal{O}(N^d)\)                              nodal points to evaluate a d-dimensional integral                              using \(N\) grid point per dimension. One method                              to mitigate the effects of <em>curse of                                dimensionality</em>, is the sparse grid method,                              where the number of grid points needed is                              \(\mathcal{O}(N(\mathrm{log}(N))^{d-1})\). The                              main ingredient of the sparse grid method is the                              tensor product of one-dimensional hierarchical                              basis. </p>                            <p>Sparse grids are not only used for approximating                              high-dimensional integrals, but it can be used to                              define adaptive quadrature methods for                              high-dimensional problems.

Idea behind using an a                              discretised system is to allow us to apply the                              theory of optimal control for linear finite                              dimensional systems to a partial differential                              equation. The control system is the same as in                              Laroche et al. paper "Motion Planning For the Heat                              Equation", however, here the approach is different                              than the approach they presented. </p>                              <p>Here we show that the optimal control for a linear parabolic partial differnetial equation, the heat equation namely, can be obtained by using methods developed primaraly for systems whose evolution is governed by a linear ordinary differential equation. In general optimal control of partial differential equations can be challenging, and one way to circumvent these challenges is to approximate the partial differential equation to a system of ordianry differential equation by using finite differencing. </p><p>Consider the 1D heat equation, which is a linear parabolic partial differential equation, $$\begin{aligned} \begin{cases}&\partial_t \phi - \kappa \partial_{xx}\phi = 0, \quad (x,t) \in [0, 1] \times [0,T],\\&\phi(0, t) = u(t),\\&\partial_x \phi(1, t) = 0, \\&\phi(x,0) = \phi_0(x), \quad \phi(x, T) = \phi_T(x),\end{cases}\end{aligned}$$where \(\kappa > 0 \) is the diffusion rate. The optimal control problem deals with finding $u$ such that the heat equation is fulfilled and in the same time minimising the following cost functional$$J(u) = \frac{1}{2}\int_0^T  u^2 \, dt $$Before discussing the approach we are using to solve this problem, we briefly summarise the fundamentals of control of linear finite-dimensional systems. Consider the linear control system given by$$\dot{x}= A x + Bu(t),$$where \(x \in \mathbb{R}^N\), \(A \in \mathbb{R}^{N\times N}\), \(B \in \mathbb{R}^{N\times M} \)and \(u \in \mathbb{R}^M\). The optimal control \(u\), that stears makes \(x\) follow a trajectory such that \(x(t_0) = x_0\) and \(x(t_1) = x_T\), is given by the expression$$ u(t) = -B^T \Phi(t_0,t)^T W_c^{-1}(t_0,t1) \left( x_0 - \Phi(t_0,t_1)x(t_0)\right),$$where \(\Phi(s,t) = e^{\int_s^t A(\tau) d\tau)} \) is the state transition matrix for \(A\), and \(W_c\) is the controllability Grammian and it is defined by$$  W_c(t_0, t_1)= \int_{t_0}^{t_1} \Phi(\tau,t_1)BB^T \Phi^T(\tau,t_1) d\tau.$$</p><p>Using the finite differencing method to approximate the heat equation For a given linear system of equations$$\begin{aligned}\mathbf{\dot{u}} &= A \mathbf{u}\end{aligned}$$it can be driven from the state \(\phi(t_0,x) \) at \(t_0\) to  \(u(t_1, x)\) at \(t_1\) and that is by adding the term \(\theta(t)\). Hence the system of linear equations would become$$\dot{\Phi }(t) = A \Phi(t) + Bu(t),$$where \(\Phi \in \mathbb{R}^N\), such that \(\Phi_i(t) = \phi(x_i, t)\), and the vector \(B\) is used to choose which state should the controller control directly. From the setting of the problem $$\begin{aligned}B = \begin{cases}        B_i = 1  &, i = N \\        B_i = 0  &, \text{ otherwise} \\    \end{cases} \end{aligned}$$Having discretised heat equation, the state transition matrix is given by$$\Phi(s,t) = e^{(t-s) A},$$and the controllability Grammian \(W_c\) is given by$$W_c(t_0, t_1)= \int_{t_0}^{t_1} e^{(t-\tau) A}BB^T e^{(t-\tau) A^T} d\tau.$$Now we can evaluate the optimal control which yields$$u(t) = -B^T \Phi(0,t)^TW_c(0, t)^{-1}( x_T - \Phi(0,t)x_0)$$                            <h5>References:</h5>                            <p>[1] - B.

The                              implementation was done in C++ and the main aim                              was to extend Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics to                              simulate stochastic fluid partial differential                              equations. </p>                            <a href="https://github.com/NaderTG/SmoothedParticleHydroCpp">This                              project's repository can be found here</a> </div>                          <div class="col-md-6"> <img src="images/portfolio-sph.jpg"                              alt="">                          </div>                        </div>                      </div>                      <div class="modal-footer"> <button type="button" class="btn btn-sm btn-default"                          data-dismiss="modal">Close</button>                      </div>                    </div>                  </div>                </div>                <!-- Modal end --> </div>              <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-3 isotope-item cfd">                <div class="image-box">                  <div class="overlay-container"> <img src="images/portfolio-lbm.jpg"                      alt="">                    <a class="overlay" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#project-13">                      <i class="fa fa-search-plus"></i> <span>Computational                        Fluid Dynamics</span> </a> </div>                  <a class="btn btn-default btn-block" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#project-13">Lattice                    Boltzmann Method</a> </div>                <!-- Modal -->                <div class="modal fade" id="project-13" tabindex="-1" role="dialog"                  aria-labelledby="project-13-label"                  aria-hidden="true">                  <div class="modal-dialog modal-lg">                    <div class="modal-content">                      <div class="modal-header"> <button type="button" class="close"                          data-dismiss="modal"><span                            aria-hidden="true">×</span><span                            class="sr-only">Close</span></button>                        <h4 class="modal-title" id="project-13-label">Lattice                          Boltzmann Method</h4>                      </div>                      <div class="modal-body">                        <h3>Project Description</h3>                        <div class="row">                          <div class="col-md-6">                            <p> Lattice Boltzmann Method is a computational                              fluid dynamics method that is used to simulate                              incompressible fluids. My introduction to the                              method came during a course on computational fluid                              dynamics. I was fascinated by the method and at                              the same time I was looking for a fast numerical                              scheme to model water flow around the surface of a                              sail boat. This project's aim was solely to hone                              my C++ programming skills and study different boat                              designs. </p>                            <p>Lattice Boltzmann Method's roots lie in kinetic                              gas theory, where the gas particles interact by                              collision. The interaction of particles amongst                              each other is not computed explicitly, however the                              statistical distribution is and it evolves                              according to the Boltzmann equation. </p>                            $$ \partial_t f + v \cdot \nabla f = \Omega, $$                            where \(f(x,v,t)\) is the probability density of                            finding the particle at position \(x\) with a                            velocity \(v\). As the name of the numerical method                            suggests, the Boltzmann equation is solved on a                            discrete grid.                            <p>Unlike normal grid methods, the grid used here                              discretises the direction of velocities \(c_i\).                              The model used in this project is the so called                              \(D3Q19\) model, where each cell in a three                              dimensional space has 19 possible direction. A                              probability density value, \(f_i\), is assigned to                              each velocity \(c_i\). The fluid particles are                              fixed in space, instead, their probability                              densities are exchanged. The Boltzmann equation on                              a discrete grid is $$ f_i(x + c_i \Delta t, t +                              \Delta t) = f_i(x,t) + \frac{1}{\tau}\left(                              f_i^{eq}(x,t) - f_i(x,t) \right) $$ </p>                            <p>Using the Chapman–Enskog expansion, the solution                              of the lattice Boltzmann method approximates the                              solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes                              equation. Furthermore, the scheme does not require                              solving algebraic equations, just substitutions,                              which makes it quicker than the standard finite                              volume method used for solving the Navier-Stokes                              equation.</p>                            <p> One of the reasons why lattice Boltzmann method                              is attractive is due to ease of implementation and                              also it can be parallelised and it was an                              oppurtunity for me to practice implementing MPI                              codes. The figures show the streamlines of the                              numerical flow, with an obstacle in the channel,                              at three different times and it is evident that                              the flow is experiencing von Kármán vortex street                              phenomenon. </p>                          </div>                          <div class="col-md-6"> <img src="images/portfolio-lbm.jpg"                              alt="">                          </div>                        </div>                      </div>                      <div class="modal-footer"> <button type="button" class="btn btn-sm btn-default"                          data-dismiss="modal">Close</button>                      </div>                    </div>                  </div>                </div>                <!-- Modal end --> </div>            </div>            <!-- portfolio items end --> </div>        </div>      </div>    </div>    <!-- section end -->    <!-- footer start -->    <!-- ================ -->    <footer id="footer">      <!-- .footer start -->      <!-- ================ -->      <div class="footer section">        <div class="container">          <h1 class="title text-center" id="contact">Contact</h1>          <div class="space"></div>          <div class="row">            <div class="col-sm-12">              <div class="footer-content">                <p class="large" style="text-align: center;">You can reach me on                  the following platforms:</p>                <ul class="social-links" style="width: 400px; margin: 0 auto;text-align: center;">                  <a href="https://github.com/NaderTG"><li class="github"><i class="fa fa-github" href="https://github.com/nadertg/"></i><br></a>                  </li>                  <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/nader-g-813832148"><li class="linkedin"><i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i><br></a>                  </li>                </ul>              </div>            </div>          </div>        </div>      </div>      <!-- .footer end -->      <!-- .subfooter start -->      <!-- ================ -->      <div class="subfooter">        <div class="container">          <div class="row">            <div class="col-md-12">              <p class="text-center">© 2019 N T Ganaba.
